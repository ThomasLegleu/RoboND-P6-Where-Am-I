Robot navigation is a robot’s ability to determine its own position within a frame of reference and generate a plan to attain a speciﬁc goal. Robot localization is the process of determining where a mobile robot is located according to a known environment. Localization is one of the most fundamental competencies required by a mobile robot and is essential to navigation. Here we will look at localization and implement the monte carlo localization algorithm through various ROS packages and nodes.
